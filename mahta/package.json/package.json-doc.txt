In the second task, I dived into understanding the package.json file and its key components while utilizing Yarn for managing dependencies. After initializing a new package.json file using yarn init, I explored the purpose and structure of the file.

Through research, I grasped the significance of key fields within the package.json, such as name, version, dependencies, devDependencies, and scripts. I incorporated dependencies like lodash and express into the dependencies field using Yarn's yarn add command.

This task deepened my understanding of dependency management with Yarn, configuring scripts, and the pivotal role of package.json in Node.js projects, but I think it would've been better if both this tasks were merged as one in the first place.
