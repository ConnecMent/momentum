Manual project dependency management is a weary task. For Node.js projects, the package.json file provides a simplified way to manage a project's metadata and dependencies.
Every npm package and Node.js project has a package.json file with metadata for a project. The file resides in the root directory of every Node.js package and appears after running the npm init command.
The package.json file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as a name, version, and dependencies. The file provides the npm package manager with various information to help identify the project and handle dependencies.
The package.json file is fully customizable and looks different for every project.
The package.json metadata fields help describe various properties of a Node.js project. The properties divide into two subtypes:
Descriptive properties help identify a project and distinguish a package if published.
Functional properties install and manage the project and its dependencies correctly.
**main Property**
The main property points to the project's entry point.
When a Node.js application imports the package through a require statement,
the package.json file uses the exports from the file in the main property and returns it to the application.
**dependencies Property**
The dependencies property is an essential field in a package.json file.
The section maps production-level dependent packages and their versions used in the project.
