JavaScript is a widely popular scripting language primarily used for web development.
JavaScript is primarily used for client-side programming, while Node.
js allows developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript on the server-side.
Node.js Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js enables developers to build scalable and high-performance web applications using JavaScript.
**Differences between Node.js and JavaScript**
*Execution Environment:
JavaScript runs in a web browser, while Node.js runs on a server.
This means that JavaScript is primarily used for client-side operations,
while Node.js is used for server-side tasks.
*Libraries and Modules:
Node.js includes a vast collection of built-in libraries and modules,
which allows it to perform complex server-side operations.
In contrast, JavaScript relies on external libraries and APIs for additional functionality.
*Concurrency Model:
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model,
which makes it ideal for handling multiple concurrent requests and building scalable applications.
JavaScript, on the other hand, operates in a single-threaded environment and mainly focuses on user interactions and DOM manipulation.
