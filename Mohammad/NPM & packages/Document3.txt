A package is a directory containing a package. js file,
which contains roughly three major sections: a basic description, a package definition,
and a test definition.
npm is the world's largest Software Registry.
The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.
The name npm (Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first was created as a package manager for Node.js.
All npm packages are defined in files called package.json.
The content of package.json must be written in JSON.
At least two fields must be present in the definition file: name and version.
Node Package Manager (NPM) is a command-line tool integral to the Node.js environment,
acting as a package manager to install, update, and manage libraries, packages,
and modules for Node.js applications.
